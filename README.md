# Movie Rating app

The idea for app is that user can search for a movie on the left hand side of the screen and a different one on the right hand side of the screen. 
When user search for it, app is going to fetch some information about that movie and show information about it on the left hand side of the screen. And then we're going to repeat that same process on the right hand side.

The information we can see about movies are Title, Box office, and Critic Rating based on Imdb API. For every different stat that we fetch about every different movie we're going to compare them between the two. Whichever movie has a higher statistic we're going to highlight in green, in whichever movies has the lower statistic we're going to show in yellow. 

The input for searching for a movie has autocomplete, whenever a user types something, we're going to have a pop-up listing that shows a couple of different movies related to the search term.
